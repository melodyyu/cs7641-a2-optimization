TO ACCESS THE CODE:
The following Box link holds the code, the data, the final report and their graphs:

Notebooks: 
- 4peaks_optimization.ipynb -- holds the code for RO algos on Four Peaks.  
- abalone_nn_final.ipynb -- part 2 of assignment, optimized weights using RO Lagos. 
- maxKColors_optimization.ipynb -- holds the code for RO algos on Max K Colors. 


Running the code should be as simple as running the notebook in its 
entirety, assuming the user has the following dependencies:
  - python=3.10
  - pip
  - pip:
    - mlrose-hiive
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
    - numpy
    - ipykernel
    - joblib<1.3.0 
    - seaborn
    - tqdm
    - time 


It's also assumed that the user has the requirements for Pyperch already installed. 

For version control purposes, the code and data can be accessed at my Github link as well:
https://github.com/melodyyu/cs7641-a2-optimization. This Github will be private after grades are returned.
